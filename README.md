# PYYouTubeVideoDownload
Python app for downloading videos from YouTube.

Libraries used: customtkinter, pytube
Originally a [tutorial project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI9LXzo0UY0&t=359s) from YouTube author [developbyed](https://www.youtube.com/@developedbyed) that I followed. 
I decided to add little more functions to it, like changing download directory and thumbnail viewer.
